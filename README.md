# Teensy Control Panel

This project consists of a PCB and arduino library that together provide various I/O capabilities for the teensy 4.0


## PCB Features
    * All jst connectors are in the XH series, except the stemma-QT connectors, which are JST-PH
    * 2x RJ45 ports, each with 4-channel GPIO capability
    * 1x JST 5-pin connector for rotary encoder
    * 8x JST 3-pin connectors for potentiometer analog inputs
    * 3x JST 2-pin connectors for switches or buttons
    * 1x JST 2-pin connector to expose the programming pin if necessary
    * 2x Stemma-QT connectors for I2C comms
        * One of these is intended to be used for an OLED screen 

## Control code features



I've only used this project for myself so far, so the documentation is sparse.
If you're interested, please reach out and I'll use that as motivation to write more clearly.
